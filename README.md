# The American Experiment

## Our fellow Americans are all human. But why don't we treat each other that way?

---

The American Experiment is an app that aims to bring people of different political ideologies together. After filling out a quick pre-survey, the user embarks on a 30-day journey with an anonymous buddy. They chat about different prompts each day, each unaware that the other has a completely different political view. The prompts get deeper, sensitive, and more thought-provoking each day. After the 30 days, the user takes a post-survey and reflects on their experience with their chatting buddy. At the very end, the identity of their chatting buddy is revealed to them—surprise surprise! It's someone they probably wouldn't have even talked to in real life!

The American Experiment allows you to talk about your hobbies and your memories without worrying about whether or not your buddy supports abortion. It teaches tolerance, it teaches inclusion, but most importantly it teaches love. And that’s exactly the purpose of this app.
